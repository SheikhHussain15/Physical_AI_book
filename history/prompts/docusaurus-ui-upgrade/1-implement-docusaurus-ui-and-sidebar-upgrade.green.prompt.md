PROMPT_TEXT: |
The user has requested to continue, and the agent has completed several implementation tasks: updating UI styling, implementing responsive design, reorganizing the sidebar, and verifying deployment configuration. The agent has also updated the To-Do list accordingly. The last user input before this was "continue". The prompt before that was asking for PHR creation. The sequence of user inputs leading to this point was: "/sp.plan", "continue", "continue", "continue", "make phr for this implementation".
