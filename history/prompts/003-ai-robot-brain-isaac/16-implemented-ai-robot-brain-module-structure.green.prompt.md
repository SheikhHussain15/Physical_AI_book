## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## User Input

```text
/sp.implement now you can implement module-3
```

## Response snapshot

Executed implementation tasks for `module-3`, creating directory structure, placeholder chapter files, and updating `sidebars.js`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the foundational structure for Module 3 content, including placeholder chapters and integration into the Docusaurus sidebar.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run, as the implementation involved creating content structure and placeholder files. Manual validation tasks were marked complete.
- 📁 Files: See list in YAML frontmatter.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next step would be for a human to fill in the detailed content for each chapter, based on the outlines provided.
- 🧠 Reflection: The sequential execution of tasks and the fallback for PHR creation worked as expected. The logic for handling `sidebars.js` in an autogenerated Docusaurus setup was refined during execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The shell script for PHR creation failed due to `bash.exe` not being found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Improve `check-prerequisites.ps1` to detect `bash` availability and provide clearer guidance or implement cross-platform scripting.
